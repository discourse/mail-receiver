# This is a basic configuration that can easily be adapted to suit a standard
# installation. For more advanced options, see openmarc.conf(5) and/or
# /usr/share/doc/opendmarc/examples/opendmarc.conf.sample.

##  AuthservID (string)
##  	defaults to MTA name
##
##  Sets the "authserv-id" to use when generating the Authentication-Results:
##  header field after verifying a message.  If the string "HOSTNAME" is
##  provided, the name of the host running the filter (as returned by the
##  gethostname(3) function) will be used.
#
AuthservID discourse-mail-receiver

##  FailureReports { true | false }
##  	default "false"
##
##  Enables generation of failure reports when the DMARC test fails and the
##  purported sender of the message has requested such reports.  Reports are
##  formatted per RFC6591.
#
# FailureReports false

##  PidFile path
##  	default (none)
##
##  Specifies the path to a file that should be created at process start
##  containing the process ID.
#
PidFile /run/opendmarc/opendmarc.pid

##  PublicSuffixList path
##  	default (none)
##
##  Specifies the path to a file that contains top-level domains (TLDs) that
##  will be used to compute the Organizational Domain for a given domain name,
##  as described in the DMARC specification.  If not provided, the filter will
##  not be able to determine the Organizational Domain and only the presented
##  domain will be evaluated.
#
PublicSuffixList /usr/share/publicsuffix/public_suffix_list.dat

##  RejectFailures { true | false }
##  	default "false"
##
##  If set, messages will be rejected if they fail the DMARC evaluation, or
##  temp-failed if evaluation could not be completed.  By default, no message
##  will be rejected or temp-failed regardless of the outcome of the DMARC
##  evaluation of the message.  Instead, an Authentication-Results header
##  field will be added.
#
# RejectFailures false

##  Socket socketspec
##  	default (none)
##
##  Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
##  connections from sendmail(8) in order to provide service.  socketspec is
##  in one of two forms: local:path, which creates a UNIX domain socket at
##  the specified path, or inet:port[@host] or inet6:port[@host] which creates
##  a TCP socket on the specified port for the appropriate protocol family.
##  If the host is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the
##  socket will be listening on all interfaces.  This option is mandatory
##  either in the configuration file or on the command line.  If an IP
##  address is used, it must be enclosed in square brackets.
#
Socket local:/run/opendmarc/opendmarc.sock

##  Syslog { true | false }
##  	default "false"
##
##  Log via calls to syslog(3) any interesting activity.
#
Syslog true

##  SyslogFacility facility-name
##  	default "mail"
##
##  Log via calls to syslog(3) using the named facility.  The facility names
##  are the same as the ones allowed in syslog.conf(5).
#
# SyslogFacility mail

##  TrustedAuthservIDs string
##  	default HOSTNAME
##
##  Specifies one or more "authserv-id" values to trust as relaying true
##  upstream DKIM and SPF results.  The default is to use the name of
##  the MTA processing the message.  To specify a list, separate each entry
##  with a comma.  The key word "HOSTNAME" will be replaced by the name of
##  the host running the filter as reported by the gethostname(3) function.
#
# TrustedAuthservIDs HOSTNAME

##  UMask mask
##  	default (none)
##
##  Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file creation.  This
##  only really applies to creation of the socket when Socket specifies a
##  UNIX domain socket, and to the HistoryFile and PidFile (if any); temporary
##  files are normally created by the mkstemp(3) function that enforces a
##  specific file mode on creation regardless of the process umask.  See
##  umask(2) for more information.
#
UMask 0002

##  UserID user[:group]
##  	default (none)
##
##  Attempts to become the specified userid before starting operations.
##  The process will be assigned all of the groups and primary group ID of
##  the named userid unless an alternate group is specified.
#
UserID opendmarc
