# Common signing and verification parameters. In Debian, the "From" header is
# oversigned, because it is often the identity key used by reputation systems
# and thus somewhat security sensitive.
Canonicalization	relaxed/simple
#Mode			sv
#SubDomains		no
OversignHeaders		From

# Signing domain, selector, and key (required). For example, perform signing
# for domain "example.com" with selector "2020" (2020._domainkey.example.com),
# using the private key stored in /etc/dkimkeys/example.private. More granular
# setup options can be found in /usr/share/doc/opendkim/README.opendkim.
#Domain			example.com
#Selector		2020
#KeyFile		/etc/dkimkeys/example.private

# In Debian, opendkim runs as user "opendkim". A umask of 007 is required when
# using a local socket with MTAs that access the socket as a non-privileged
# user (for example, Postfix). You may need to add user "postfix" to group
# "opendkim" in that case.
UserID			opendkim
UMask			007

# Socket for the MTA connection (required). If the MTA is inside a chroot jail,
# it must be ensured that the socket is accessible. In Debian, Postfix runs in
# a chroot in /var/spool/postfix, therefore a Unix socket would have to be
# configured as shown on the last line below.
